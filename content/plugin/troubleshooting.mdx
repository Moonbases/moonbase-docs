<Callout type="info" title="Quick checks">
  Confirm the API is running, the plugin file exists, and the plugin is registered where required.
</Callout>

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion title="Plugin not loading (backend)">
    - Ensure the file is in `api/plugins` and ends with `.js`, `.cjs`, or `.mjs`.
    - Check API logs for "Failed to load plugin".
    - Make sure the plugin exports `register` or is a function.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plugin not rendering (frontend)">
    - Confirm the plugin file lives in `app/plugins` and exports a default plugin object with a `name`.
    - Ensure the plugin is registered in `app/plugins/registry.ts`.
    - Make sure `PluginHost` wraps the app in `app/app/layout.tsx`.
    - If using `mounts`, verify the selector exists in the DOM.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Checkout guard not running">
    - Use `api.createCheckoutSession` or `api.createCartCheckout`, which call guards.
    - If you call the API directly, call `runCheckoutGuards` first.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
