description: Get access to the repository, clone it locally, and pull updates.

Use GitHub for painless updates without downloading new release packages each time.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### 1. Access the repository

    - **Download from BuiltByBit (optional):** If you already installed via BuiltByBit and want to stay there, you can keep updating manually.
    - **Request GitHub access:** After your BuiltByBit download, open a #ticket. You will be granted access to the private GitHub repo.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### 2. Clone the repo

    - Remove the old BuiltByBit copy if you are switching.
    - Open a terminal or PowerShell where you want the project.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aledlb8/moonbase.git
    ```

    You now have a `moonbase` folder in your chosen directory.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### 3. Pulling updates

    Whenever a new release drops:

    ```bash
    cd moonbase
    git pull
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Your `.env` files stay local and are not committed to Git. If we add or rename env variables, update them manually when told.
