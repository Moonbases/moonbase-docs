This guide walks you through installing Moonbase from GitHub, getting your API keys, and wiring up payments.

<Callout type="info" title="Self-hosted by design">
  Your base URL is the host where you run Moonbase. API keys are printed once in the server console on first startup.

## <Rocket className="inline size-4 align-text-bottom" /> Installation via GitHub

Weve moved Moonbase to GitHub to make updates seamless no more downloading new release packages every time.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### 1. Access the Repository

  - **Download from BuiltByBit (optional):**

    If youve already installed via BuiltByBit and prefer to stick with that, you can continue updating manually.

  - **Request GitHub Access:**

    Once youve downloaded via BuiltByBit, open a #ticket. Ill grant you access to our GitHub repo so you can clone and pull future updates directly.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### 2. Clone the Repo

  - **Remove the BuiltByBit copy** (if you plan to switch).

  - **Navigate** to your preferred folder in a terminal/PowerShell.

  - **Run:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aledlb8/moonbase.git
    ```

  - Youll now have a `moonbase` folder in your chosen directory.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### 3. Pulling Updates

  Whenever we publish a new release:

  ```bash
  cd moonbase
  git pull
  ```

  <Callout type="note" title="Environment files stay local">
    The `.env` files (your secret keys) are **not** tracked by Git. If we ever change the required variables, Ill let you know so you can update them manually.
  </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## <Settings className="inline size-4 align-text-bottom" /> Initial Setup

Once youve cloned (or updated) the code, youll see this structure:

<Files>
  <Folder name="moonbase" defaultOpen>
    <File name="install.bat" />
    <File name="api.bat" />
    <File name="app.bat" />
    <Folder name="api" defaultOpen>
      <File name=".env" />
      <File name="index.js" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
      <File name=".env" />
      <File name="(front-end files)" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

```
moonbase/
 install.bat
 api.bat
 app.bat
 api/
   .env
   index.js
 app/
    .env
     (front-end files)
```

### - Install Dependencies

```bash
.\install.bat
```

This installs everything for both the API and the APP.

### - First Run

```bash
.\api.bat
```

* When you run this, youll receive a **Public API Key** and a **Private API Key**.
* **Save them immediately** youll only see them once.
* Open `app/.env` and paste each key into the corresponding variable.

```
PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_public_key_here
PRIVATE_API_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

Then you can configure the rest of the `.env` values in the API and APP directory

## Rebuild

```
cd app
npm run build
```

### 4. Launch the App

```bash
.\app.bat
```

At this point, your API and front-end should be running ready for you to start selling!
