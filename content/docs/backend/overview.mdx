description: How the API loads and runs plugins.
---

The backend plugin loader scans for JavaScript plugins at startup and loads them in order.

## Plugin locations
The loader checks these directories (first match wins):

- `plugins`
- `api/plugins`
- the packaged plugins directory next to the loader (internal fallback)

In most cases you should place plugins in `api/plugins`.
Plugins load in alphabetical order by filename.

## Supported files
- `.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`
- or a folder with `index.js` (or `index.cjs`, `index.mjs`)
- entries starting with `_` or `.` are ignored

## Plugin shape
```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  enabled: true,
  version: '0.1.0',
  register(ctx) {
    ctx.logger.info('plugin loaded');
  }
};
```

If you omit `name`, the filename becomes the plugin name.

You can also export a function directly:

```js
module.exports = function register(ctx) {
  // ...
};
```

`init(ctx)` is treated the same as `register(ctx)`.

The loader logs successful and failed plugins at startup.
If `enabled` is `false`, the plugin is skipped and the API logs that it is disabled.
