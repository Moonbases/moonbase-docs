title: Moonbase Plugin System
description: Extend the backend and frontend without touching core code.

Moonbase ships with two plugin runtimes: a backend loader for the API and a frontend runtime for the Next.js app. Backend plugins are loaded from disk at runtime; frontend plugins are compiled into the app and registered explicitly.

## At a glance
- Backend: drop a file in `api/plugins` and restart the API.
- Frontend: add a plugin under `app/plugins` and register it in `app/plugins/registry.ts`.

## Two runtimes
- Backend plugins run inside the API and can register routes, patch services, or listen to purchase flows.
- Frontend plugins run inside the app and can render UI, open modals, and block checkout via guards.

Pick the runtime that matches the change you want: data and workflows in the backend, UI and flow control in the frontend.

## What a plugin can do
- Add new API endpoints and middleware.
- Inject UI into existing pages or global layout.
- Validate checkout prerequisites before payment.
