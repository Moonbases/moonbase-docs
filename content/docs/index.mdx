title: Moonbase Plugin System
description: Extend the backend and frontend without touching core code.
---

Moonbase ships with two plugin runtimes: a backend loader for the API and a frontend runtime for the Next.js app. Plugins live outside the bundled output, so they are easy to add or remove.

## Two runtimes
- Backend plugins run inside the API and can register routes, patch services, or listen to purchase flows.
- Frontend plugins run inside the app and can render UI, open modals, and block checkout via guards.

## What a plugin can do
- Add new API endpoints and middleware.
- Inject UI into existing pages or global layout.
- Validate checkout prerequisites before payment.
